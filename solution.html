    <p><b>Solution:</b> No.</p>
    <p>
      Any $2 \times 1$ or $1 \times 2$ block always covers one dark square and
      one light square. Thus any configuration of these blocks covers an equal
      number of light and dark squares.
    </p>

    <p>
      In board $B$, there are $30$ dark squares and $32$ light squares. Assume
      that there is a configuration of blocks that covers board $B$: this
      configuration of blocks covers a different number of light and dark
      squares. A contradiction.

      field of math that typically studies various counts and configurations of
      finite structures.
